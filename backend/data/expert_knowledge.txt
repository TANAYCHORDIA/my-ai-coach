Fact 1: Lower Back Pain Safety
For users with lower back pain, avoid barbell deadlifts, heavy squats, and high-impact running. Safe alternatives: goblet squats, bird-dogs, glute bridges, and swimming. Always focus on core stabilization.

Fact 2: Strength Training Protocol
Strength goals require 3-5 sets of 4-6 reps at 85-95% 1RM. Rest 3-5 minutes between sets. Focus on compound movements: squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press.

Fact 3: Beginner Guidelines
Beginners should start with 2-3 full-body workouts per week. Focus on movement patterns (squat, hinge, push, pull). Use bodyweight or light weights for 2-4 weeks. Prioritize form over weight.

Fact 4: Basketball Training
Basketball players need explosive power (box jumps), lateral agility (ladder drills), vertical jump training, and ankle stability work (single-leg balance). Warm-up must include ankle mobility.

Fact 5: Warm-Up Best Practices
Effective warm-ups: 5-10 minutes light cardio, dynamic stretching (leg swings, arm circles), and activation exercises (glute bridges, band walks). Never skip warm-ups before heavy lifting.
